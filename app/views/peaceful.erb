INGREDIENTS:TOTAL TIME: 40 MINS PREP TIME: 10 MINS COOK TIME: 30 MINS
CHICKEN BAKED ZITI INGREDIENTS:
12 ounces ziti (or any pasta shape)
2 cups shredded, cooked chicken (about 2 small chicken breasts)
1 batch alfredo sauce (see below)
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (I used 2% low fat)
(optional toppings: additional shredded Parmesan cheese, chopped fresh parsley)
ALFREDO SAUCE INGREDIENTS:
1 Tbsp. olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 Tbsp. flour
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup low-fat milk (I used 1%)
3/4 cup freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
*This isn’t a super-saucy dish, so if you like a lot of sauce, you might want to consider doubling this recipe. If you don’t have the time to make your own sauce, one standard-sized jar should be enough.

DIRECTIONS:

TO MAKE THE CHICKEN BAKED ZITI:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Cook the pasta al dente in a large stockpot of well-salted boiling according to package instructions. Drain. Return pasta to the stockpot and add chicken and alfredo sauce. Gently toss to combine until the pasta is evenly coated.
Pour half of the pasta into a greased baking dish (either an oval baking dish, as pictured above, or a 9 x 13-inch baking dish will work). Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup of cheese. Layer the remaining half of the pasta evenly on top. Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until the cheese is melted and just barely starts to turn golden. Remove and serve immediately, sprinkled with additional toppings if desired.
TO MAKE THE ALFREDO SAUCE:
Heat olive oil in a large sauce pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute one minute, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Sprinkle with flour, and stir to combine. Saute for an additional minute to cook the flour, stirring occasionally.
Slowly add chicken broth, whisking to combine until smooth. Whisk in milk, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let cook for an additional minute until thickened, then stir in Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper until the cheese melted. Remove from heat and set aside.

INGREDIENTS:
1 small red onion, diced
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 red bell pepper, cored and diced
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chilies, drained (or 1 jalapeno, diced)
1 cup corn kernels, fresh or frozen and defrosted
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
12 ounces salsa or enchilada sauce
1 and 1/2 cups cooked Planet Rice California Sprouted Brown Rice
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese*
1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese*
serving suggestions: fresh cilantro, diced green onions, avocado

DIRECTIONS:
Start by warming the oil in a large skillet (mine is 3 quarts) over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes, then add the spices (cumin to oregano) and stir together. Continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes.
Next add the red pepper and the green chilies and stir together. Cook for another 2-3 minutes then add the drained and rinsed beans, corn, salsa, and rice. Stir everything until well-combined.
Turn the oven to broil then top the mixture in the skillet with the shredded cheese. Place the skillet in the oven and cook for about 3-4 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly on top. Serve warm with diced green onions, cilantro, and/or avocado.
*To make it vegan, skip the broiling step and drizzle it with this Nacho Cashew Cream.

Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
